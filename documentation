We have an add program:

Q: So a big question is what do you want to verify?
A: Lets suppose that the sign of the answer is always
positive.

Procedure:
1. Write a program in C.
2. Use Clang to get the LLVM IR.

---
Next steps which I want to take:
3. Convert LLVM IR in form of some clauses.
4. Make it in form of SMT encodings.


Some points to remember:

1. What category of invariants are they?
- I am talking more about the safety invariants and those
type of invariants.
