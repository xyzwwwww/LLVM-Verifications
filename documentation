We have an add program:

Q: So a big question is what do you want to verify?
A: Lets suppose that the sign of the answer is always
positive.

Procedure:
1. Write a program in C.
2. Use Clang to get the LLVM IR.

---
Next steps which I want to take:
3. Convert LLVM IR in form of some clauses.
4. Make it in form of SMT encodings.


Some points to remember:

1. What category of invariants are they?
- I am talking more about the safety invariants and those
type of invariants.
- Other way to define this is - application specific
invariants.

Other types of categories which I have come across:
1. consistency invariants: Yggdrisal
2. Termination : Seahorn
3. Invariants for the trap handlers : Hyperkernel
4. Numerical invariants: multiple paper which use the concept
of using numerical invariants to find the security flaws in
the work.

There can be multiple types of invariants but the big question
that pops in my head is what is specific to cyber physical
systems. What are the type of invariants which
are specifically represented for a cyber physical system?

1. Domain specificity:
In that the invariants which can be defined are the control
laws for a cyber-physical system. They will be defined as the
application specific invariants.
